# Code of Ethics

CoAI Network commits to promoting Artificial Intelligence that:

1. **Protects human dignity**
   AI should uplift people's abilities and respect their autonomy.

2. **Minimizes harm**
   Safety, security and potential negative impacts must be continuously evaluated.

3. **Ensures transparency and accountability**
   Clear documentation of goals, datasets, processes and evaluation.

4. **Promotes fairness and equity**
   AI must avoid reinforcing discrimination or social inequality.

5. **Safeguards privacy**
   Data rights and informed consent are fundamental.

6. **Supports accessibility**
   AI benefits should reach diverse populations and not be restricted to the privileged.

7. **Encourages responsible innovation**
   Exploratory research must consider foreseeable consequences.

Our ethical commitments evolve as the community grows and new challenges emerge.
We will review this Code regularly with interdisciplinary input.
