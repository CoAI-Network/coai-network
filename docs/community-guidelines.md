companies, researchers and developers from all over the world.

To ensure that discussions remain constructive and inclusive:

1. **Respect first**
   Treat people with dignity, even when opinions differ.
   - 🚫 No harassment, insults, discriminatory language, or personal attacks.

2. **Evidence-based contribution**
   When discussing scientific or technical topics, provide references where possible.

3. **Privacy protection**
   Do not share private information without explicit consent.

4. **No harmful intent**
   Content that promotes real-world harm (e.g., weapons, malware, unsafe experiments)
   is not allowed.

5. **Conflict transparency**
   Declare affiliations or conflicts of interest when relevant.

6. **Clear and accessible language**
   If using technical terms in public threads, explain them briefly.

7. **Open moderation**
   Moderation decisions are transparent and may be appealed respectfully.

8. **Ethical responsibility**
   Projects involving human data or participation must go through our Ethics Committee.

These guidelines apply to every member, to build a safe, collaborative
and enriching community for all.
