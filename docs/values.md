# Values

Our core values guide all decisions, collaborations and discussions
within CoAI Network. They ensure that Artificial Intelligence evolves
aligned with human principles.

1. **Human-centered**
   AI must serve human well-being, upholding dignity, rights, and inclusion.

2. **Transparency**
   Openness in methods, motivations, data, and limitations builds trust.

3. **Scientific Rigor**
   Claims must be supported by evidence, peer review, and reproducibility.

4. **Inclusion**
   We welcome diverse backgrounds and perspectives; accessibility is a priority.

5. **Ethical Precaution**
   We act responsibly when consequences are uncertain; safety first.

6. **Collaboration**
   Progress emerges from interdisciplinary partnerships and shared knowledge.

Together, these values form the foundation of a global movement toward
beneficial and accountable AI.
