# Privacy Policy (Summary) — CoAI Network

CoAI Network collects only the minimum information needed to operate (public username, optional email, project descriptions). We do not share personal data without consent.

We rely on third-party services (GitHub, Discord, Neocities). Users should review their policies as well.

This is an initial policy and will be updated as the community grows.
