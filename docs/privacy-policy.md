# Privacy Policy (Summary)

CoAI Network collects only the minimum necessary information to operate
our services (such as a public username, contact email if voluntarily
provided, and descriptions of projects shared).

We do not sell or share personal data without consent.

We currently rely on third-party platforms (GitHub, Discord, Neocities),
therefore users should also review their individual policies.

This initial version will evolve as our infrastructure expands and we
implement authentication, dashboards, or newsletters.
